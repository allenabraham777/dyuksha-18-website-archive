        "The Finalised rules will be disclosed just before each round",
        "<b>ROUND 1</b>-A circuit will be given for you. It is your job to implement it and run .Also need to find the type of wave generated",
        "<b>ROUND 2</b>-The given circuit will contain some errors. The candidate must rectify it and run the circuit to generate the required wave form",
        "<b>ROUND 3</b>-Two different circuits will be provided for you. The contestant should produce the wave form which is expected from you",
        "<b>ROUND 4</b>-A wave form will be given to you. You should now design the circuit for which the given wave form as the output",
